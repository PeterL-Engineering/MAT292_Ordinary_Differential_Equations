\section{Electrochemical Biology of Neurological Signals}
\label{app:b_electrochemical_biology}

The generation and propagation of neural signals relies on sophisticated electrochemical mechanisms that regulate ion flow across cell membranes. 
This section examines two fundamental components: voltage-gated ion channels that enable rapid electrical signaling, and the sodium-potassium pump that maintains the resting potential essential for neuronal excitability.

\subsection{Voltage-Gated Ion Channels}
\label{app:b_1_ion_channels}

Ion channels use several mechanisms to facilitate movement, for example, active transport against a concentration gradient, or passive transport with the concentration gradient. 
Passive systems employ gating, ion conductance, and selectivity to regulate movement. Gated channels leverage protein C- and N-termini to open and close a pore across transmembrane domains, increasing control of ion flow. 
A common gating mechanism are voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs), which regulate transport via transmembrane voltage changes. 
VGICs are critical to neurons and play key roles in repolarization, signal regulation, and propogation of electrical impulses \cite{rubaiy2017electrophysiology}. 

\subsection{Sodium-Potassium Pump}
\label{app:b_2_sodium_potassium_pump}

A concentration imbalance exists between the internal and external environments of a cell, with potassium ($K^{+}$) being high within the cell and low outside, and sodium ($Na^{+}$) being low within the cell and high outside. 
In the resting state, the membrane is more permeable to $K^{+}$, meaning an entity must maintain this electric gradient and reduce $K^{}$ loss. This entity is the sodium-potassium pump, which uses an energy source called ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to remove three $Na^{+}$ for every two $K^{+}$ that enter. 
This creates a more negative environment, regulating the cell membrane resting potential. 
The $Na^{+}$/$K^{+}$ pump also plays a role in the modulation of neurotransmitter receptors in neurons \cite{pivovarov2018na/kpump}. 

\section{Improved Euler's Method \& Runge-Kutta Method}
\label{app:c_numerical_methods}
Numerical methods for solving differential equations largely constitute a family of techniques that refine and extend the fundamental principles of Euler's Method. 
This section details two such advanced methods we will employ: the Improved Euler's Method and the classical Runge-Kutta Method, both of which offer significant gains in accuracy and efficiency.

\subsection{Improved Euler's Method}
\label{app:c_improved_eulers}

While Euler's Method provides insight into solution behavior, it requires very small time steps to achieve reasonable accuracy due to error accumulation. 
Improved Euler's Method addresses this limitation by incorporating a more sophisticated slope estimation.

The method builds intuitively upon Euler's foundation: rather than relying solely on the derivative at the beginning of each interval, it computes the derivative at both the starting point and an Euler-predicted endpoint, then uses their average for the final step. 
This predictor-corrector approach yields significantly better accuracy with fewer computations.

The general formulation is given by:
\[
    y_{n+1} = y_{n} + \frac{f_{n} + f(t_{n} + h, y_{n} + hf_{n})}{2} \cdot h
\]
where 
\[
    h = t_{n+1} - t_{n} \quad \text{and} \quad f_{n} = f(t_{n}, y_{n})
\]

\subsection{Runge-Kutta Methods}
\label{app:c_runge_kutta}

While both Euler's Method and Improved Euler's Method technically fall within the Runge-Kutta family, this section focuses on the classical fourth-order method developed by Runge and Kutta. 
Often referred to simply as ``the'' Runge-Kutta Method, this approach is more precisely classified as a fourth-order, four-stage method.

The key innovation lies in computing a weighted average of slopes at strategically chosen points within each time step $\Delta t$, building upon the foundational ideas of the simpler methods. 
This sophisticated sampling provides greater accuracy than either Euler or Improved Euler methods alone.

The general form for advancing the solution is:
\[
    y_{n+1} = y_{n} + h \cdot \frac{k_{n1} + 2k_{n2} + 2k_{n3} + k_{n4}}{6}
\]
where $h = \Delta t$ and the intermediate slopes are defined as:
\begin{align*}
    k_{n1} &= f(t_{n}, y_{n}) \\
    k_{n2} &= f\left(t_{n} + \frac{1}{2}h, y_{n} + \frac{1}{2}hk_{n1}\right) \\
    k_{n3} &= f\left(t_{n} + \frac{1}{2}h, y_{n} + \frac{1}{2}hk_{n2}\right) \\
    k_{n4} &= f(t_{n} + h, y_{n} + hk_{n3})
\end{align*}
